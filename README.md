üìΩÔ∏èMovie App

This movie app that I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows you to search for movies and watch trailers, descriptions, and ratings, as well as explore other sections such as "What's playing now in cinemas" and more. Through the app, you can quickly find essential information about your favorite movies and explore new ones, with an optimized experience for app users.
